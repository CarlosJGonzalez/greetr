Custom Laravel Package
A stand-alone source code which can be imported into projects using a package managment tool( Composer ) instead of copying and pasting the library source code to another project.
Developers only need to import the package and call any service that it provides.

These source code can be versioned separatly from the main source code and can have its own test and manage its own dependencies.

Creating our own maintened packages means high-efficiency and high productivity output.
